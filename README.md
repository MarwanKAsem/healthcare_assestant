# ü©∫ Symptom-to-Disease Classification

This repository contains a machine learning pipeline for classifying diseases based on reported symptoms. The project aims to support health-assistance applications by mapping user-described symptoms to likely diseases.

## Features

* End-to-end workflow in Jupyter Notebook
* Data preprocessing and symptom encoding
* Machine learning training and evaluation
* Performance metrics including accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score
* Confusion matrix visualization

## üìÇ Project Structure

```
Symptom_to_Disease_Classification.ipynb   # Main notebook
data/                                     # Dataset storage (optional)
README.md                                 # Project overview
requirements.txt                          # Python dependencies
```

## Methods

* Cleaning and encoding symptom data
* Feature engineering
* Model selection (e.g., Random Forest, Logistic Regression, etc.)
* Cross-validation for evaluation
* Confusion matrix analysis

## Results

* Baseline accuracy and evaluation metrics (to be updated after experiments)
